Idea#6: Lucy keeps our seniors happy and engaged
#1 problems our seniors (over 80) face today is loneliness and isolation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau 11 million, or 28% of people aged 65 and older, lived alone at the time of the census. As people get older, their likelihood of living alone only increases. Additionally, more and more older adults do not have children, reports the AARP, and that means fewer family members to provide company and care as those adults become seniors.
1. Senior isolation increases the risk of mortality.
2. Feelings of loneliness can negatively affect both physical and mental health.
3. Perceived loneliness contributes to cognitive decline and risk of dementia.
4. Social isolation makes seniors more vulnerable to elder abuse.
5. Loneliness in seniors is a major risk factor for depression.
6. Socially isolated seniors are more pessimistic about the future.

Lucy is a skill developed for Amazon Alexa device echo dot which sits in senior’s room.

A group of student volunteers write personal emails to our seniors . Lucy reads those emails to seniors as they come or at certain time.


Topic 2 : A Depression Detection Model Based on Sentiment Analysis for detecting depressed ones and preventing suicide in online social networks.
Today the different social networking sites have enabled everyone to easily express and share their feelings with people around the world. A lot of people use text for communicating, which can be done through different social media messaging platforms available today such as Twitter, Facebook etc, as they ﬁnd it easier to express their feelings through text instead of speaking them out. Depression stands out to be one of the most well known mental health disorders and a major issue for medical and mental health practitioners. Legitimate checking can help in its discovery, which could be useful to anticipate and prevent depression all-together.

Topic 3 : Twitter trending topic detection system
It makes sense that we would want to know more about what is suddenly increasing in popularity. Knowing what is suddenly increasing in popularity is incredibly important to news organizations, retailers, first responders, government entities and more. At a more specific level, knowledge of trending topics tells us about what people are attracted to, what people think is noteworthy or important and what people make the effort to pass on or share. Armed with that knowledge, businesses can begin to make very effective real-time decisions.

Topic 4 : RecipeAI
People often tend to find recipes online and start preparing them only to realise later that they are missing some ingredients. This project plans to implement a recipe finder/generator based on the ingredients provided by the user. This will help people cook with what is available, rather than following some recipe with a few less ingredients in it.
Also, a feedback system can be implemented asking the user for how the recipe turned out to be. And this can help to recommend recipes as well.
