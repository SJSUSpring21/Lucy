## Problem statement

Number one problems our seniors (over 80) face today is loneliness and isolation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau 11 million, or 28% of people aged 65 and older, lived alone at the time of the census. As people get older, their likelihood of living alone only increases. Additionally, more and more older adults do not have children, reports the AARP, and that means fewer family members to provide company and care as those adults become seniors.
1. Senior isolation increases the risk of mortality.
2. Feelings of loneliness can negatively affect both physical and mental health.
3. Perceived loneliness contributes to cognitive decline and risk of dementia.
4. Social isolation makes seniors more vulnerable to elder abuse.
5. Loneliness in seniors is a major risk factor for depression.
6. Socially isolated seniors are more pessimistic about the future.

Lucy is a skill developed for Amazon Alexa device echo dot which sits in seniorâ€™s room.

A group of student volunteers write personal emails to our seniors . Lucy reads those emails to seniors as they come or at certain time.
